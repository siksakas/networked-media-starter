    <h1>The Empty Bedroom</h1>
    <br>
    <p>At first this was where all of us slept, then just my parents for a bit.</p>
    <p>At night everyone who slept here complained about hearing footsteps or strange noises, and</p>
    <p>my mom was convinced they came from antique items my dad brought home.</p>

    <p>I never really believed in it, but whenever I was alone in this room I'd always feel uneasy and</p>
    <p>try to leave right away. It wasn't that I thought the room felt haunted, it just felt weird.</p>
