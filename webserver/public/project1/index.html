        <h1>My Home</h1>
        <p>This was the layout of my home in Bangkok, Thailand. I lived here
          until I moved to the United States in 2015. The entire apartment
          building

          was demolished soon after I moved, and we didn't keep many photos of
          it.

          I didn't notice until I redrew this, but the layout is quite odd I
          think.

          While I don't think its haunted or anything like that, there were strange thigns about the house.
