    <h1>The Buddha Room</h1>
    <br>
    <p>The Buddha room, or the prayer room, is the only room of which I have no photos.</p>
    <p>I only went in maybe five or six times my entire time living here. There were maybe</p>
    <p>fifty statues all lined up, some stacked higher than others.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What I remember is a hidden cabinet behind one of the statues, which opened when</p>
    <p>you push on the wall. I once saw my Dad open it, but I never looked inside myself.</p>
    <p>The room always felt weird to me, it was always cold even in the Thai summer heat.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I found a similar looking room <a href="https://asia-archive.si.edu/exhibition/tibetan-buddhist-shrine-room/" target="_blank">here,</a> but this one is less populated by statues.</p>
