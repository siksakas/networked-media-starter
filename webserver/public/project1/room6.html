    <h1>Stairway</h1>
    <br>
    <p>The stairway I'm writing about is in the background, and the weird thing was</p>
    <p>that my parents locked entry to it with a fingerprint scanner. Only a few people</p>
    <p>could unlock it, not me or my two sisters, they said it would stop us from getting</p>
    <p>hurt going down the stairs.</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>It is a bit hard to see in the photo since it is blurry, but between the two paintings you can see</p>
    <p>the scanner on the other side. I always thought that was a weird explanation.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Downstairs was a second living room along with another entrance to the apartment.</p>
    <p>This next part seems crazy, and I'll understand if you do not believe me, but behind where the TV was</p>
    <p>mounted was a hidden room. I didn't even think about it until I began writing this because it wasn't crazy</p>
    <p>for me at the time, but when you pressed on the wall behind the TV it would open a bit and you could pull</p>
    <p>the door open. Inside was nothing special: old toys, old books, stuff we'd never use on a daily basis.</p>
    <p>My dad described it as somewhere we could hide if someone broke in, but that seems unlikely considering we</p>
    <p>lived on the 22nd floor.</p>
