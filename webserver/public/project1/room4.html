    <p>This room was set up as a closet but I never saw anyone working in it. The only thing I remember is a</p>
    <p>filing cabinet falling over, locking my dad in the prayer room. When my nanny heard him banging on the door</p>
    <p>to be let out, she ran away because she was convinced of a ghost.</p>
