    <h1>Living Room</h1>
    <br>
    <p>We spent all of our freetime in this room. Me and my sister would play games here all day, play with</p>
    <p>our toys, ride around the room in our little bikes. </p>

    <p>I loved reading, and the bookshelf in the background of the photo was later swapped with a bigger one.</p>

    <p>Before I was maybe 3-4 this was the only room other than the bedroom I spent a lot of time in, in the house. Behind those</p>
    <p>gates to leave it was always dark so I didn't want to leave anyways, but my sister always tried to climb over them.</p>
    <p>I remember laughing at her attempts to climb over, especially because she never gave up.</p>
